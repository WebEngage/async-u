# async Âµ
A micro implementation of [caolan/async](https://github.com/caolan/async) for `async.mapParallel`, `async.mapSeries`, `async.series` and `async.parallel` only

[async.mapParallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#map) | 
[async.mapSeries](https://github.com/caolan/async#map) | 
[async.series](https://github.com/caolan/async#seriestasks-callback) | 
[async.parallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel)

#### The BIG question?
Why use this module when the [original](https://github.com/caolan/async) is more comprehensive, more battle tested and may be even more efficient.  
Well the only reason is the orignal's size - at 29.6KB uncompressed, it might seem like an overhead to those who only need the above four methods. 

#### Install
```
npm install --save async-u
```
