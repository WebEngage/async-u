# async Âµ
A micro implementation of [caolan/async](https://github.com/caolan/async) for these four methods only

[async.mapSeries](https://github.com/caolan/async#map) |
[async.mapParallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#map) |
[async.series](https://github.com/caolan/async#seriestasks-callback) |
[async.parallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel)

The interface is identical except for these small differences
- `series()` and `parallel()` do not accept an object as `tasks`
- `series()` tasks are passed the result of their predecessor as the second argument

#### The BIG question?
Why use this module when the [original](https://github.com/caolan/async) is more comprehensive, more battle tested and might be even more efficient.
Well the only reason is the orignal's size - at [17.6 KB uncompressed](https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/master/dist/async.min.js), it may look bloated to those who only need the four methods.

#### Install
```
npm install --save async-u
```

and...
```js
var async = require('async-u');
```

Use a [frontend module bundle](http://www.slant.co/topics/3900/~frontend-javascript-module-bundlers) to package for browsers
